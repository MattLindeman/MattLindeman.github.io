In my previous post I discussed why and how I collected college basketball data to run a brief analysis. I also included a brief view at what the data looks like, which I will not include here, and a list of what all the basketball abbreviations mean, which I will include at the bottom of the page. In this post I want to pose a few questions and then explain how I explored those questions through graphics I created from the data. 

# Questions

1. Which statistic(s) correlates the most with wins?
2. How much does strength of schedule impact winning?
3. Which teams/conferences have won the most over the past 5 seasons?
4. Does defensive efficiency or offensive efficiency matter more?

# Insights

### Win Correlation

To test how the statistics are correlated with wins I decided to look at a heatmap for the numeric variables.

![Figure](/assets/images/WinsHeatmap.jpg)

I mostly looked at the first row of numbers since my goal was to find what correlated the most with wins. It wasn't surprising to see that AdjOE and AdjDE were the two highest correlations. Having a good offense and/or having a good defense normally leads to more wins.

The correlation that surprised me the most was 3PR or three point rate being almost 0. With modern basketball moving more towards shooting threes more often and more efficiently, I was expecting a more positive correlation between wins and 3PR. However, if I were to guess why this might be the case I would probably look towards team's styles of play. There are many teams that shoot threes almost exclusively and don't get very many wins, and there are many teams that rarely shoot threes and win almost every game. I think this may be causing the correlation to drift more towards 0, even though some teams are starting to shoot more threes than they used to.

### Strength of Schedule

To test how strength of schedule interacts with wins I calculated the correlation between the two and I also plotted a scatter plot with a regression line.

![Figure](/assets/images/WinsVSoS.jpg)

The correlation between SoS and wins was 0.287, so a slightly positive correlation. The plot helps to show a slight trend of increasing wins with increasing strength of schedule. While this isn't surprising to me, I was still curious to visualize this relationship. The reason this isn't surprising to me is that the teams that generally have the hardest schedules are the best teams, and the teams that have easiest schedules are generally the worst teams. There is a lot of middle ground in the statement, but because there is that slight distinction it makes sense that a harder schedule (a schedule filled with more top rated opponents) is slightly correlated with more wins. 

### Team Wins

An easy way to visualize who the best teams have been over the past 5 seasons is to look at their total wins over that span.

![Figure](/assets/images/TopWins.jpg)

For those that follow college basketball, the majority of the teams on the list are to be expected because they are consistently good and often compete for national championships. The team that made this list that was most surprising to me was Drake. Drake is not a team that consistently competes for a national championship, but they do consistently dominate their lower level conference and take advantage of their lower strength of schedule. This has led to them winning a lot of games over the past 5 years and often making the March Madness tournament.

After viewing that graph I wanted to see if I could make a similar graph that took into account strength of schedule to see which teams have had the strongest resumes.

![Figure](/assets/images/WeightedWins.jpg)

Since the SoS metric is on a scale from 0 to 1, I did a simple multiplication of a team's total wins by their average SoS to add a weight factor to their wins. I expected many of the same teams to stay on the list, but it was interesting to see that Kansas took a jump from 3rd in total wins to 1st in total weighted wins by a decent margin. Gonzaga took an expected big hit because the conference they play in, WCC, tends to have weaker teams when compared to the conferences that Kansas, Houston, and Duke play in. 

### Conference Wins

Looking behind the scenes as to why Gonzaga took a big hit to their weighted wins was a perfect segue to making a graph that shows the average wins per team by conference.

![Figure](/assets/images/WinByConf.jpg)

From this graph it can be seen that the WCC is the 7th best conference when it comes to average wins per team, so that can help explain Gonzaga's slight drop in the previous graph when compared to Kansas playing in the Big 12 and Duke playing in the ACC. One really cool note I took from this is which conferences are in the top six. In college basketball there are six conferences that are referred to as the power six conferences, or in other words the strongest conferences. These six conferences are the Big 12, Big 10, SEC, ACC, Pac 12, and Big East, and those are also the six conferences that have the most average wins per team. 

### Power Six

After seeing that the power six conferences were the top 6 in the previous graph, I wanted to make a comparison between those six conference's average AdjOE and AdjDE per team.

![Figure](/assets/images/EfficiencyConf.jpg)

All of these conferences have high and comparable ratings for offensive efficiency and defensive efficiency, but it is interesting to note that the Big 12, who had the most average wins per team, had the second highest average AdjOE and the highest AdjDE and the Big 10, who had the second most average wins per team, had the highest average AdjOE and the second highest AdjDE. 

### Defensive or Offensive Efficiency

The last graph I am going to share relates to my last question about AdjOE or AdjDE being more impactful. While this is hard to quantify or visualize, I took an approach that removed teams that were really good in both categories and compared teams that were really good in only one of the categories.

![Figure](/assets/images/EfficiencyComp.jpg)

This graph compares the average wins for teams that were either in the top 10% for AdjOE or the top 10% for AdjDE. From this it appears to me that there is a slight edge to having a more efficient offense over having a more efficient defense. Obviously you want an efficient offense and efficient defense to be an elite team, but it was interesting to see that teams in the top 10% for AdjOE averaged about 3 more wins per season than teams in the top 10% for AdjDE.

# Summary

As mentioned through this post so far, I had many surprising finds, as well as a few expected outcomes. The most intriguing insights to me were the non-correlation between 3PR and wins and the difference in average wins for teams with a high AdjOE rather than a high AdjDE. I also learned that offensive efficiency appears to have a slightly bigger impact than defensive efficiency. Utimately, studying these metrics showed me that there are many different ways to get wins in college basketball. I really enjoyed my time spent exploring this dataset and I hope to do a deeper analysis with it in the future!
