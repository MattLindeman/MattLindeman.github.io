In my previous post I discussed why and how I collected college basketball data to run a brief analysis. I also included a brief view at what the data looks like, which I will not include here, and a list of what all the basketball abbreviations mean, which I will include at the bottom of the page. In this post I want pose a few questions and then explain how I explored those questions through graphics I created from the data. 

# Questions

1. Which statistic(s) correlates the most with wins?
2. How much does strength of schedule impact winning?
3. Which teams/conferences have won the most over the past 5 seasons?
4. Does defensive efficiency or offensive efficiency matter more?

# Insights

### Win Correlation

To test how the statistics are correlated with wins I decided to look at a heatmap for the numeric variables.
